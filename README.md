This repository contains a CSS bug report demonstrating unexpected behavior when using pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) within media queries. The bug manifests as missing or incorrectly rendered content from the pseudo-element specifically within the specified media query range, while other styles work correctly. The inconsistency across browsers points towards a possible rendering bug or an obscure interaction between media queries and pseudo-element content generation in CSS. A solution is provided in `bugSolution.css` to work around the issue. The solution might involve alternative approaches to style and position content for the different screen sizes, ensuring consistent rendering.

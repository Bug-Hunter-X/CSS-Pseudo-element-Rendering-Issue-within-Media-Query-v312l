The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when a pseudo-element (such as ::before or ::after) is used within a media query. The content of the pseudo-element is not being displayed or rendered correctly within the specific media query range, even though the rest of the styles applied within the media query are working as expected. This behavior is inconsistent across different browsers, suggesting a possible rendering bug or an obscure CSS specification quirk related to the interaction between media queries, pseudo-elements, and content generation.
